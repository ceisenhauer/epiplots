## tldr.
`epiplots` is inspired by `ggpubr`. Like `ggpubr` it aims to make building publication ready ggplots easier and faster, but with a specific focus on the types of plots used in epidemiology. Think time series and regression summaries. `epiplots` also includes a variety of geoms and utility functions as useful extras.

## plans.
- [ ] plot_map
- [ ] plot_estimates
- [ ] geom_time_periods (shaded option)
- [ ] geom_event_lines
- [ ] plot_timeseries
- [ ] plot_stackseries (proportion option)
